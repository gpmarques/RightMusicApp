Bm                       D         A\
How the hell did we wind up like this\
            Bm\
Why weren't we able\
             D             A\
To see the signs that we missed\
           Bm\
And try to turn the tables\
                   D            A\
I wish you would unclench your fists\
            Bm\
And unpack your suitcase\
                     D            A\
Lately there's been too much of this\
           Bm\
Don't think its too late\

( Em )\

Pre-chorus:\
Em\
Nothin's wrong, just as long as\
A5\
you know that someday I will\
\
Chorus:\
G       D\
Someday, somehow\
A5                 Bm\
gonna make it alright but not right now\
G         A5        Bm\
I know you're wondering when\
                 A5\
(You're the only one who knows that)\
G       D\
Someday, somehow\
A5                 Bm\

\
       Bm                 D              A5\
Well I hoped that since we're here anyway\
         Bm\
We could end up saying\
                      D          A5\
Things we've always needed to say\
             Bm\
So we could end up stringing\
\
\
Bm                D               A5\
Now the story's played out like this\
                  Bm\
Just like a paperback novel\
                  D           A5\
Lets rewrite an ending that fits\
               Bm\
Instead of a hollywood horror\
